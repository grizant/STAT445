## 1. Conducting a simulation-based power analysis

We are going to continue the drug effect model that was discussed in the
"Simulation" lecture. That is, we will simulate the effects of using a drug
and not using a drug to see hypothetically. This will allow us to investigate
how different parameters of our model affect the number of subjects needed to 
observe a significant difference without calculating complicated math.

Suppose that there is a new drug that can be optionally given before chemotherapy. 
We follow the setup given in the "Simulation" lecture.
We believe those who arenâ€™t given the drug experience a reduction in tumor size of percentage
$$
X_{\mathrm{no\,drug}} \sim 100 \cdot \mathrm{Exp}(\mathrm{mean}=R), 
\;\;\; R \sim \mathrm{Unif}(0,1),
$$
whereas those who were given the drug experience a reduction in tumor size of percentage
$$
X_{\mathrm{drug}} \sim 100 \cdot \mathrm{Exp}(\mathrm{mean}=2).
$$
Here $\mathrm{Exp}$ denotes the exponential distribution, and $\mathrm{Unif}$ the uniform distribution. Now consider the following scenario. In the following questions, we will set up a way to simulate this model.
  
- **1a.** The first function we write will generate the simulation
data. Write a function called `simulate_data(n, mu_drug)` that
produces measurements in the drug and no drug groups. Your function
should take two inputs: `n`, the sample size (i.e., number of subjects
in each group), with a default value of 60; and `mu_drug`, the mean
for the exponential distribution that defines the drug tumor reduction
measurements, with a default value of 2. Your function should return a
list with two vectors called `no_drug` and `drug`. Each of these two
vectors should have length `n`, containing the percentage reduction in
tumor size under the appropriate condition (not taking the drug or
taking the drug). (Hint: This function should use `rexp`
appropriately.)

- **1b.** We will now use `simulate_data()` for different seed
settings to see if we are properly generating data. Run
`simulate_data()` without any arguments (hence, relying on the default
values of `n` and `mu_drug`), and store the results in `results_1`.
Print out the first 6 values in both the `results_1$no_drug` and
`results_1$drug` vectors. Now, run `simulate_data()` again, and store
its value in `results_2`. Again, print out the first 6 values in both
the `results_2$no_drug` and `results_2$drug` vectors. We have
effectively simulated two hypothetical datasets. Hence, the values in
each of these 4 vectors should all be different.

- **1c.** Even though we simulated two datasets (each with completely
different values), we would still like to ensure that in both
datasets, the mean value of `no_drug` is roughly the same across all
datasets, and the value of `drug` is value the same across all
datasets. Compute the following three numbers: the absolute difference
in the mean values of `no_drug` between `results_1` and `results_2`,
the absolute difference in the mean values of `drug` between
`results_1` and `results_2`, and the absolute difference in mean
values of `no_drug` and `drug` in `results_1`. Of these three
numbers, which one is the largest, and does this make sense? (Hint: By
absolute difference, we mean you should compute the difference and
then take the absolute value.)

- **1d.** Now, we want to visualize the dataset. Fortunately, the code
to visualize the dataset is already provided for you in the
"Simulation" lecture, but it is not written as a function. We will
write a function `plot_data(data)` that does this. This function has
one input: `data` with no default value. `data` represents the dataset
that `simulate_data()` generates. Follow the code in the "Simulation" lecture (where you will only need to make minor modifications) so `plot_data(data)` visualizes `data`. Specifically, your function will plot two histograms, one for `data$no_drug` (in gray) and `data$drug` (in red) with the same 20 bins, overlay a
density curve for each histogram in the appropriate colors, and plot a
legend.

- **1e.** We will now use `plot_data()` to plot three different
datasets (and thus make three different plots). Run `plot_data()` on
`results_1`. Then, `plot_data()` on `results_2`. As mentioned in
Question 1b and 1c, these datasets should be different. Hence, their
respective plots should not be exactly the same, but they should look
"similar". Then, in one line, generate a new dataset using
`simulate_data()` where `n` is 1000 and `mu_drug` is 1.1, and plot the
data using `plot_data()`. In one or two sentences, describe some major
differences that you see between this third plot and the first two
plots.

- **1f.** In the next section to come, we will be generating many
hypothetical datasets to see how many subjects we need to observe a
difference between taking the drug and not taking the drug. To do
this, we will write a function called `simulate_difference()`, which
takes in the same two arguments as `simulate_data()`, which are `n`
and `mu_drug`, both of which use the same default parameters as
`simulate_data()`. This function will generate a new dataset using
`simulate_data()` using the appropriate inputs, and compute the
difference in means between `drug` and `no_drug` (no absolute value).
That is, the mean value of `drug` minus the mean value of `no_drug`.
Your function should return this value. Run this function twice with
no arguments (hence, using the default parameters) to see that your
function is returning different numbers, and run the function once
with `n=1000` and `mu_drug=10`. Print out all 3 return values. This
last value should be substantially larger than the first two.

### Investigating your simulation

With your simulation set up, we can now investigate how the parameters
of our simulation (namely, `n` and `mu_drug`) affect the outcomes.
While the relationship between `n`, `mu_drug` and the outcome of
`simulate_difference()` are not too hard to mathematically derive in
this particular lab, you can imagine much more complicated models
where it's easier to simulate the model instead of mathematically
deriving the answer.

The next few questions will work with this hypothetical: suppose we
work for a drug company that wants to put this new drug out on the
market. In order to get FDA approval, your company must demonstrate
that the patients who had the drug had **on average** a reduction in
tumor size **at least 100 percent greater than** those who didn't
receive the drug, or in math: $$ \overline{X}_{\mathrm{drug}} -
\overline{X}_{\mathrm{no\,drug}} \geq 100. $$ Your drug company wants
to spend as little money as possible. They want the smallest number n
such that, if they were to run a clinical trial with n patients in
each of the drug / no drug groups, they would likely succeed in
demonstrating that the effect size (as above) is at least 100. Of
course, the result of a clinical trial is random; your drug company is
willing to take "likely" to mean **successful with probability 0.95**,
i.e., successful in 190 of 200 hypothetical clinical trials (though
only 1 will be run in reality).

- **2a.** Following the code sketch provided in the "Simulation"
lecture, write a function called `rep_sim`. This function
takes in 4 arguments, `nreps` (the number of repetitions, with default
value of 200), `n` and `mu_drug` (the values needed for
`simulate_difference()`, with the same default values) and `seed`
(with default value `NULL`). This function should run
`simulate_differences()` `nreps` number of times, and then return the
number of success, i.e., the number of times that the output of
`simulate_difference()` exceeds 100. Demonstrate your function works
by using it on `mu_drug = 1.5`. (Note: While you could use a for-loop
(shown in lecture) or one of the `apply` functions, for this
question, you can also use the `replicate` function. Be sure to check
the documentation for `replicate` if you are unfamiliar with it.
Essentially, `replicate` takes in two arguments, the number of
replications you want to perform and the expression you are
replicating.)

- **2b.** We will now investigate the effect of `n`, where `mu_drug`
is fixed to be 2. For each value of the input `n` (the sample size) in
between 5 and 100 (inclusive), run your function `rep_sim`. You can do
this using a for-loop or one of the `apply` functions, and store the
number of success in a vector. So to be clear, for each sample size in
between 5 and 100, you should have a corresponding number of
successes. Plot the number of successes versus the sample size, and
label the axes appropriately. Based on your simulation, what is the
smallest sample size for which the number of successes is 190 or more?

- **2c.** Now suppose your drug company told you they only had enough
money to enlist 20 subjects in each of the drug / no drug groups, in
their clinical trial. They then asked you the following question: how
large would `mu_drug` have to be, the mean proportion of tumor
reduction in the drug group, in order to have probability 0.95 of a
successful drug trial? Run a simulation, much like your simulation in
the last problem, to answer this question. Specifically, similar to
before, for each value of the input `mu_drug` in between 0 and 5, in
increments of 0.25, run your function `rep_sim()`, with `n=20` and
`nreps = 200`. Plot the number of successes versus the value of
`mu_drug`, and label the axes appropriately. What is the smallest
value of `mu_drug` for which the number of successes exceeds 190?

- **Challenge** In this last question, we will be modifying the simulation
setup and see how it changes the results we observe. Here, we will not
provide you with the step-by-step details of how to explicitly change
the setup. Here is the new setup: suppose we start with `n=5` subjects (as
before, this means 5 subjects with the drug, 5 subjects without the
drug). We compute the difference in means between using the drug and
not using the drug (just like before). If this difference is equal to
or larger than 100, we declare success and stop. Here is the change:
if the difference is smaller than 100, we collect 5 new subjects with
the drug and 5 new subjects without the drug. Then, once again, we
compute the difference in means between the subjects with the drug and
the subjects without the drug, and we declare success if this
difference is equal to or larger than 100. We keep incrementing by 5
new subjects with the drug and without the drug until we have a total
of 60 subjects with the drug and 60 subjects without the drug. If we
*still* do not observe a difference in means larger than 100 at this
point, then we declare the a failure. Change the functions
`simulate_data()`, `simulate_difference()` and `rep_sim()` if
necessary to accommodate this new scheme. Then, similar to Question
2a, run this simulation with 200 repetitions with `mu_drug = 1.5`, and
print out how many success there were. How does this number compare
with the result in Question 2a?

## 2. Randomization (permutation) test

The built-in R data set `chickwts` records weights in grams of six groups of newly attached chicks that are fed different supplements. Conduct randomization tests to assess two claims:

- **3a.** Assess the claim that the "soybean" and "linseed" groups have different (population) average weights. Interpret the results in words, numerical evidence, and plot(s).

- **3b.** Assess the claim that the "soybean" and "linseed" groups have different (population) median weights. Interpret the results in words, numerical evidence, and plot(s).

## 3. MC Integration

Use Monte Carlo integration to estimate the following integrals. Compare with the exact answer, if known.

- **4a.** $\int_1^3 x^2 dx$
- **4b.** $\int_0^3 sin(e^x)dx$
- **4c.** $\int_0^2 \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-x^2/2}dx$
