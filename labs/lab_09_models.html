<div id="simple-exploration-and-linear-modeling" class="section level1">
<h1>Simple exploration and linear modeling</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>1a.</strong> Define <code>pros.df.subset</code> to be the subset of observations (rows) of the prostate data set such the <code>lcp</code> measurement is greater than the minimum value (the minimum value happens to be <code>log(0.25)</code>, but you should not hardcode this value and should work it out from the data). As in lecture, plot histograms of all of the variables in <code>pros.df.subset</code>. Comment on any differences you see between these distributions and the ones in lecture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1b.</strong> Also as in lecture, compute and display correlations between all pairs of variables in <code>pros.df.subset</code>. Report the two highest correlations between pairs of (distinct) variables, and also report the names of the associated variables. Are these different from answers that were computed on the full data set?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Challenge.</strong> Produce a heatmap of the correlation matrix (which contains correlations of all pairs of variables) of <code>pros.df.subset</code>. For this heatmap, use the full matrix (not just its upper triangular part). Makes sure your heatmap is displayed in a sensible way and that it’s clear what the variables are in the plot.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1c.</strong> Compute, using <code>lm()</code>, a linear regression model of <code>lpsa</code> (log PSA score) on <code>lcavol</code> (log cancer volume). Do this twice: once with the full data set, <code>pros.df</code>, and once with the subsetted data, <code>pros.df.subset</code>. Save the results as <code>pros.lm.</code> and <code>pros.subset.lm</code>, respectively. Using <code>coef()</code>, display the coefficients (intercept and slope) from each linear regression. Are they different?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1d.</strong> Simulate <em>fake-data</em> from the two simple linear regression models developed in <strong>1c</strong> above. Do this by setting the true slope and intercept equal to the point estimators of the coefficients (given by <code>coef()</code>) and the sigma equal to the <code>Residual standard error</code> for each model. Use the observed <code>lcavol</code> values (the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>) to generate the <code>lpsa</code> (the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>) from the model <span class="math inline">\(y = \alpha + \beta x + \epsilon\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2)\)</span>. In this way you will have the same number of observations as in the real data set. Fit a linear model to each fake-data set and report the <code>summary()</code>. Did you get what you expect? How do you know?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1e.</strong> Repeat the <em>fake-data</em> experiment 1000 times for each model and verify that you are getting the coverage rates you expect within 1 and 2 standard deviations of the slope estimator.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1f.</strong> Let’s produce a visualization to help us figure out how different these regression lines really are. Plot <code>lpsa</code> versus <code>lcavol</code>, using the full set of observations, in <code>pros.df</code>. Label the axes appropriately. Then, mark the observations in <code>pros.df.subset</code> by small filled red circles. Add a thick black line to your plot, displaying the fitted regression line from <code>pros.lm</code>. Add a thick red line, displaying the fitted regression line from <code>pros.subset.lm</code>. Add a legend that explains the color coding.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1g.</strong> Finally, use <em>predictive simulations</em> to evaluate how well the model fits the data, for both models developed. Do this by simulating from a Normal distribution specified as <span class="math inline">\(Y \sim N(\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}x, \hat{\sigma}^2)\)</span>. Do this 100 times for each model and make plots comparing actual <code>lpsa</code> values to the simulated values. Are the models producing <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> values close to the actual observed <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> values? Do you see any bias (peaks in different places) or increased/decreased variation? Differences in number of modes? Anything else?</p></li>

<div id="reading-in-exploring-wage-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Reading in, exploring wage data</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>2a.</strong> A data table of dimension 3000 x 11, containing demographic and economic variables measured on individuals living in the mid-Atlantic region, is up at <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/statcomp/data/wage.csv" class="uri">http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/statcomp/data/wage.csv</a>. (This has been adapted from the book <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/">An Introduction to Statistical Learning</a>.) Load this data table into your R session with <code>read.csv()</code> and save the resulting data frame as <code>wage.df</code>. Check that <code>wage.df</code> has the right dimensions, and display its first 3 rows. Hint: the first several lines of the linked file just explain the nature of the data; open up the file (either directly in your web browser or after you download it to your computer), and count how many lines must be skipped before getting to the data; then use an appropriate setting for the <code>skip</code> argument to <code>read.csv()</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2b.</strong> Identify all of the factor variables in <code>wage.df</code>, set up a plotting grid of appropriate dimensions, and then plot each of these factor variables, with appropriate titles. What do you notice about the distributions?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2c.</strong> Identify all of the numeric variables in <code>wage.df</code>, set up a plotting grid of appropriate dimensions, and then plot histograms of each these numeric variables, with appropriate titles and x-axis labels. What do you notice about the distributions? In particular, what do you notice about the distribution of the <code>wage</code> column? Does it appear to be unimodal (having a single mode)? Does what you see make sense?</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="wage-linear-regression-modeling" class="section level1">
<h1>Wage linear regression modeling</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>3a.</strong> Fit a linear regression model, using <code>lm()</code>, with response variable <code>wage</code> and predictor variables <code>year</code> and <code>age</code>, using the <code>wage.df</code> data frame. Call the result <code>wage.lm</code>. Display the coefficient estimates, using <code>coef()</code>, for <code>year</code> and <code>age</code>. Do they have the signs you would expect, i.e., can you explain their signs? Display a summary, using <code>summary()</code>, of this linear model. Report the standard errors and p-values associated with the coefficient estimates for <code>year</code> and <code>age</code>. Do both of these predictors appear to be significant, based on their p-values?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>3b.</strong> Save the standard errors of <code>year</code> and <code>age</code> into a vector called <code>wage.se</code>, and print it out to the console. Don’t just type the values in you see from <code>summary()</code>; you need to determine these values programmatically. Hint: define <code>wage.sum</code> to be the result of calling <code>summary()</code> on <code>wage.lm</code>; then figure out what kind of R object <code>wage.sum</code> is, and how you can extract the standard errors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>3c.</strong> Plot diagnostics of the linear model fit in the previous question, using <code>plot()</code> on <code>wage.lm</code>. Look at the “Residuals vs Fitted”, “Scale-Location”, and “Residuals vs Leverage” plots—are there any groups of points away from the main bulk of points along the x-axis? Look at the “Normal Q-Q” plot—do the standardized residuals lie along the line <span class="math inline">\(y=x\)</span>? Note: don’t worry too if you’re generally unsure how to interpret these diagnostic plots; you’ll learn a lot more in a regression course; for now, you can just answer the questions we asked. <strong>Challenge</strong>: what is causing the discrepancies you are (should be) seeing in these plots? Hint: look back at the histogram of the <code>wage</code> column you plotted above.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>3d.</strong> Refit a linear regression model with response variable <code>wage</code> and predictor variables <code>year</code> and <code>age</code>, but this time only using observations in the <code>wage.df</code> data frame for which the <code>wage</code> variable is less than or equal to 250 (note, this is measured in thousands of dollars!). Call the result <code>wage.lm.lt250</code>. Display a summary, reporting the coefficient estimates of <code>year</code> and <code>age</code>, their standard errors, and associated p-values. Are these coefficients different than before? Are the predictors <code>year</code> and <code>age</code> still significant? Finally, plot diagnostics. Do the “Residuals vs Fitted”, “Normal Q-Q”, “Scale-location”, and “Residuals vs Leverage” plots still have the same problems as before?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>3e.</strong> Use your fitted linear model <code>wage.lm.lt250</code> to predict: (a) what a 30 year old person should be making this year; (b) what President Trump should be making this year; (c) what you should be making 5 years from now. Comment on the results—which do you think is the most accurate prediction?</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="wage-generalized-additive-modeling-challenge" class="section level1">
<h1>Wage generalized additive modeling (challenge)</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>4a.</strong> Install the <code>gam</code> package, if you haven’t already, and load it into your R session with <code>library(gam)</code>. Fit a generalized additive model, using <code>gam()</code> with <code>family=&quot;binomial&quot;</code>, with the response variable being the indicator that <code>wage</code> is larger than 250, and the predictor variables being <code>year</code>, <code>age</code>, and <code>education</code>; as in the last question, only use observations in <code>wage.df</code> corresponding to the complete education levels. Also, in the call to <code>gam()</code>, allow for <code>age</code> to have a nonlinear effect by using <code>s()</code> (leave <code>year</code> and <code>education</code> alone, and they will have the default—linear effects). Call the result <code>wage.gam</code>. Display a summary with <code>summary()</code>. Is the <code>age</code> variable more or less significant, in terms of its p-value, to what you saw in the logistic regression model fitted in the last question? Also, plot the fitted effect for each predictor, using <code>plot()</code>. Comment on the plots—does the fitted effect make sense to you? In particular, is there a strong nonlinearity associated with the effect of <code>age</code>, and does this make sense?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>4b.</strong> Using <code>wage.gam</code>, predict the probability that a 30 year old person, who earned a Ph.D., will make over $250,000 in 2018.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>4c.</strong> For a 32 year old person who earned a Ph.D., how long does he/she have to wait until there is a predicted probability of at least 20% that he/she makes over $250,000 in that year? Plot his/her probability of earning at least $250,000 over the future years—is this strictly increasing?</p></li>
